        <h2>Introduction of Babcock Ice Cream</h2>
            <div class = "color-block">
        <p>
            Babcock Hall, established in 1951, has contributed to this reputation, establishing ice cream as a symbol both of Wisconsin’s dairy farming past and its appeal as a summer destination for tourists from around the world.
            Babcock Hall was named after Stephen Babcock, a professor at the University of Wisconsin. In 1890 Professor Babcock invented the first machine to test the butterfat content of milk. This invention helped to establish 
            Wisconsin as the dairy state, because it let consumers know that the milk they were purchasing tasted good and was safe to drink. “Babcock”, then, seems a fitting name for a building that now produces 75,000 gallons of 
            ice cream a year (from cream that contains at least 10% butterfat) as well as milk and gourmet cheese.
